# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to perform Customer Segmentation using data science techniques, including data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and deployment. This project demonstrates expertise in machine learning, statistics, cloud platforms, and effective communication of insights.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail).

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three parts:
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
2. Machine Learning Model Development
3. Deployment & Business Impact Analysis

## Tasks
### Part 1: Data Exploration & Preprocessing
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform initial data analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and potential data quality issues.
2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**: Preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and create meaningful features for model training.

### Part 2: Machine Learning Model Development
3. **Model Selection & Training**: Develop and compare multiple machine learning models to solve a predictive problem.
4. **Model Evaluation & Interpretation**: Assess model performance, optimize hyperparameters, and explain key insights from the model.

### Part 3: Deployment & Business Impact Analysis
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as an API or a simple application for real-world usability.
6. **Business Insights & Recommendations**: Present actionable insights derived from the data and model for business decision-making.

### Additional Tasks on RFM Customer Segmentation
7. **RFM Analysis Implementation**: Perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation using the Online Retail Dataset. Calculate RFM scores for each customer and segment them into different categories (e.g., VIP, Frequent, Lost Customers).
8. **Customer Segmentation Insights**: Analyze the RFM segments and interpret business implications. Identify key customer groups that can be targeted for marketing campaigns.
9. **Visualization & Reporting**: Create visual representations of the RFM segments (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to support insights. Provide a structured report explaining the segmentation results and recommendations for customer engagement strategies.
